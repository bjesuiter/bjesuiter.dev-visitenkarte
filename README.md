## Original Concept

Initial idea for this project: build the page like a real-world contact card with
interactive 3D tilt that reacts to mouse movement. That concept is intentionally
parked for now because the interaction complexity was too high for the first
iteration.

## Icon Usage

- Find Icons here: `https://icon-sets.iconify.design/?query=astro`
  - alternative icon browser: https://icones.js.org/
- install necessary icon pack, for example: logos:
  `bun add @iconify-json/logos`
- use as `<Icon name="logos:github-icon" />`

## TODOs

- optimize images: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGGnanUKM00
- add a full menu with "BJesuiter", "CodeMonument" und "Impressum"
- add complete localization as english and german!
